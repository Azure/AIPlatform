# Create Azure Machine Learning service and configure compute clusters

In this article, we will show you how to create Azure Machine Learning service and configure compute clusters in the Azure Machine Learning workspace.

## Create Azure Machine Learning service in Azure portal

[This document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-manage-workspace#create-a-workspace) shows you how to create Azure Machine Learning service in Azure portal

## Create a compute cluster in Azure Machine Learning workspace

Follow [this instruction](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-set-up-training-targets#portal-create) to create a compute cluster in Azure Machine Learning service workspace and record the compute cluster name.

## (Optional) Create a Azure Kubernetes Cluster

If you want to deploy the ML models to an Azure Kubernetes cluster, follow [this instruction](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-deploy-azure-kubernetes-service#create-a-new-aks-cluster) to create an AKS cluster in Azure Machine Learning workspace and record the AKS cluster name.

If you want to deploy the ML models to Azure Container Instances, you don't need to create AKS cluster here.
